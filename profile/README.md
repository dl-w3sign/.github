w3sign is an innovative application designed to streamline the process of signing documents using Metamask addresses. With w3sign, users can effortlessly sign and manage their documents, ensuring security and authenticity throughout the process.

The application enables users to download a document and designate the Metamask addresses of other individuals who need to sign it. w3sign then generates a unique hash for the document and timestamps it to the blockchain using a choice of popular networks like Polygon, Ethereum, or Q.

The application has no backend and no database. This ensures that no data and confidential documents are kept safe. This approach ensures transparency, traceability, and immutability of the signed documents.

By leveraging the power of blockchain technology and Metamask integration, w3sign offers a reliable and efficient solution for document signing, revolutionizing the way individuals and businesses handle important agreements and contracts.
